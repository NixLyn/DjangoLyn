Check remote branch version:

```
git remote -v
```

Create new branch:

```
git branch -M <BranchName>
```

List all local branchs:

```
git branch --list
```

Push to Branch:

```
git push -u origin <BranchName>
```

Compare Branches:

```
git checkout <BranchName>
```
^ if this goes well:

```
┌──$ git checkout TestBranch 
└─>branch 'TestBranch' set up to track 'origin/TestBranch'.
└─>Switched to a new branch 'TestBranch'
```
Then Merge:

```
┌──$ git merge
└─Already up to date.
```

Check merge progress: (If larger)

```
┌──$git merge --progress
└─>Already up to date.

```

Now in order merge the branch to Master, you must go into GitHub.com..
you will see the big green buttons :P :D

After Mergeing (Squash) you can go ahead and delete the branch :)

Then, all members of the Repo will need to:

```
git pull
```

Before business can continue as usual :>


If you are not intending on using the branch again:

```
git branch --delete <BranchName>
```

Else, just use it again for the continual battle :~}
